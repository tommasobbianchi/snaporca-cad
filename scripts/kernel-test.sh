# Headless CAD-kernel test loop. THE verification contract for delegated work:
# exit 0 means the kernel builds and the selected Catch2 tags pass. Nothing else counts.
#
# Builds only the `libslic3r_tests` target (not the GUI app), so a round trip is
# minutes, not tens of minutes. Needs no display: every [CadDocument] case builds a
# CadDocument, recompute()s it and asserts on geometry.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/kernel-test.sh                        # [CadDocument] tags, default volume
#   scripts/kernel-test.sh --tags '[CadDocument],[Sketch]'
#   scripts/kernel-test.sh --vol wt_mirror        # private build cache (parallel workers)
#   scripts/kernel-test.sh --host tommaso@100.103.234.2   # build on a remote host
#
# Parallel workers MUST pass a distinct --vol: two builds sharing one cache corrupt
# each other. A new volume pays one full build; runs after that are incremental.
#
# --host exists because the deps image lives wherever it was first built. It rsyncs this
# working tree to a per-volume staging dir on that host and re-runs this same script
# there, so the verification contract is identical either way. Drop --host once the image
# is present locally.
