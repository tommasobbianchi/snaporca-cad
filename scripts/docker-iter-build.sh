# Incremental slicer build against the snaporca-deps base image.
#
# The deps-baked image (built from scripts/Dockerfile.deps) carries the pinned
# dependencies at /OrcaSlicer/deps/build/destdir. This script mounts the LIVE source
# tree and resources over the baked copy so code/CMake edits apply immediately, and
# persists /OrcaSlicer/build in a named volume so ninja recompiles only what changed.
#
# Result: edit -> rebuild in seconds-to-minutes instead of a full Docker rebuild.
#
# Usage (run on the build host, e.g. behemoth, from anywhere):
#   scripts/docker-iter-build.sh
#   IMAGE=snaporca-deps scripts/docker-iter-build.sh
#
# On success the binary is inside the persistent volume at
# /OrcaSlicer/build/package/bin/snapmaker-orca (copy it out with a follow-up
# `docker run --rm -v snaporca_buildcache:/b alpine cp ...` or via this script's tail).
# Rig build traps already paid for once each (stale project, NLopt cache, pybind11, OCCT_LIBS, SLIC3R_CAD gate): docs/rig_build_traps.md

# The root CMakeLists.txt and cmake/ must be mounted too, not taken from the baked image:
# they carry the build-time gates (e.g. SLIC3R_CAD -> add_definitions(-DSLIC3R_CAD)) that the
# mounted headers are compiled against. With a stale baked copy the gate silently stays off and
# the build fails with "class GLCanvas3D has no member named set_design_sketch_tool".
